# Graphs-Bipartite

Description from open.kattis.com:

Walter was once a promising chemist. Now he teaches high school students chemistry, and was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. 
In both desperation and excitement he decides to use his chemistry skills to produce 
illegal drugs and make quick money for his family. He forms a partnership with one of his old students, Jesse, who has some experience 
with the drug scene.
Now Walter and Jesse are preparing for their first “cook” (the process of making the drugs). 
They have a list of items they need for the cook, but they realized they have to be very careful when going to the store. 
The reason is that it may be suspicious to buy certain pairs of items, like cold medicine and battery acid, in the same trip.
They decide to divide the items among themselves, so that each of them can go one trip to the store and buy their share of 
items without the risk of anyone becoming suspicious. Help them find such a division, or tell them that it is not possible.
